# GOPI
This is a simple JSON parser that I made in go using my [parser combinator library](https://github.com/BlackBuck/pcom-go). Feel free to clone/fork it for your own use ;)
If you decide to use it, just run a `go mod tidy` after cloning locally.
<h6> P.S. Please don't ask me where this name came from. </h6>
